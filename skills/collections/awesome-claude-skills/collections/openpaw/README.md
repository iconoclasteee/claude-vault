## What is OpenPaw?

[Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) is powerful, but out of the box it only knows how to code. OpenPaw turns it into a full personal assistant — one that reads your email, plays your music, controls your lights, manages your calendar, tracks your packages, and remembers what you told it last week.

Run one command and OpenPaw:

- **Installs 38 skills** across email, calendar, Spotify, smart home, Slack, GitHub, Obsidian, and more
- **Sets up the CLI tools** each skill needs (via Homebrew, npm, or pip) and walks you through auth
- **Gives Claude an identity** — a name, personality, and persistent memory across sessions
- **Configures permissions and safety hooks** so Claude can act autonomously without doing anything dangerous
- **Adds a Telegram bridge** so you can talk to Claude from your phone
- **Includes a task dashboard** — a local kanban board with drag-and-drop and 3 themes
- **Enables smart scheduling** — recurring tasks with per-run and daily cost caps so nothing runs away
- **Can paw-style Claude Code itself** — branded colors, spinners, input highlighting, and chat styling via `openpaw theme`

After setup, you just talk to Claude:

```
"Check my email and summarize anything urgent"
"Play lo-fi beats on Spotify"
"Turn the bedroom lights to 20%"
"What's on my calendar tomorrow?"
"Add milk to my reminders"
"Go to Hacker News and summarize the top 5 posts"
```

Claude figures out which skill to use. No special syntax needed.

**No daemon, no cloud, no subscriptions.** OpenPaw runs once, writes config, and gets out of the way. Everything runs locally through your existing Claude Code subscription.

## Quick Start

```bash
npx pawmode
```

The wizard walks you through picking skills, choosing your interface (terminal, Telegram, or both), setting up a task dashboard, and authenticating with services. Or skip the wizard entirely:

```bash
npx pawmode --preset essentials       # common skills, no prompts
npx pawmode --preset developer --yes  # fully non-interactive
```

</p>

**Scheduling** — Recurring tasks with per-run and daily cost caps. `openpaw schedule add "weekdays 8am" --run "check email"`.

**Claude Code Paw Theme** — Patch Claude Code with OpenPaw styling using tweakcc plus a native mascot fallback patch. Run `openpaw theme install` and then `openpaw theme verify`, or opt into it during `openpaw setup`. If your Claude Code build accepts custom themes, switch inside Claude Code with `/theme openpaw`; otherwise you still get the Paw mascot, welcome copy, mascot colors, lock-in status line, spinner, and input styling.

**CLAUDE.md Integration** — OpenPaw writes a section into `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` so Claude knows its name, installed skills, and personality on every session start. Your existing CLAUDE.md content is preserved.
