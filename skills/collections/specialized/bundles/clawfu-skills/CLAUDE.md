## The 201 Gap (Core Positioning)

> "The training market has bifurcated into 101 (basics) and 401 (technical implementation). It has skipped the middle entirely, and the middle is where most of the productivity gains live."

**GUIA fills the 201 Gap** — the applied judgment layer between "how to prompt" and "how to build AI agents."

### The 6 Skills That Actually Matter (201 Level)

None of these are prompting techniques:

| Skill | Description | How GUIA Addresses It |
|-------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Context Assembly** | Knowing what info to provide, from which sources | Templates prepare optimal context |
| **Quality Judgment** | Knowing when to trust output vs verify | Skill Boundaries + Checkpoints |
| **Task Decomposition** | Breaking work into AI-appropriate chunks | Step-by-step Instructions |
| **Iterative Refinement** | Moving from 70% to 95% through passes | Iteration Guide section |
| **Workflow Integration** | AI embedded in work, not separate activity | Use Cases + How to Use |
| **Frontier Recognition** | Knowing where AI excels vs fails for YOUR work | Skill Boundaries section |

### Centaur vs Cyborg Modes

Skills are tagged by work pattern (Harvard/BCG study):

| Mode | Icon | Description | Best for |
|------|------|-------------|----------|
| **Centaur** | 🐴 | Divided work — human strategy/judgment, AI executes | High-stakes, accountability needed |
| **Cyborg** | 🤖 | Integrated workflow — fluid human/AI collaboration | Creative, iterative, building |
| **Both** | ⚡ | Flexible — use either depending on context | Thinking tools, flexible frameworks |

**Distribution**: 52 Centaur (57%) | 26 Cyborg (29%) | 13 Both (14%)

### Key Insight

> "AI isn't a tool skill. It's a management skill. The best users of AI are good managers."

Skills teach management principles applied to AI collaboration, not prompting tricks.

## Skill Development Workflow

### 1. Source Collection

**Books/Courses** - Manual summaries in `sources/books/`
```bash
sources/books/april-dunford-obviously-awesome.md
```

**YouTube Videos** - Automated transcript extraction
```bash
# Extract transcript from YouTube
python scripts/youtube_extractor.py "URL" \
  --channel "channel-slug" \
  --title "Video Title" \
  --tags "tag1,tag2"

# Output: sources/youtube/channels/{channel}/{video-slug}.md
```

**See** `docs/sources-strategy.md` for full source acquisition strategy.

### 2. Create Skill
```bash
# Follow template in templates/skill-template.md
# Output to skills/[category]/[skill-name]/SKILL.md
```

### 3. Quality Review
Apply checklist:
- [ ] Methodology sourcée et crédible
- [ ] Structure conforme au template v2
- [ ] Minimum 2 exemples concrets
- [ ] Instructions actionables
- [ ] Références vérifiables
- [ ] **NEW**: "What Claude Does vs What You Decide" section present
- [ ] **NEW**: "Skill Boundaries" with clear limitations
- [ ] **NEW**: "Iteration Guide" with follow-up prompts
- [ ] **NEW**: Mode tag in metadata (centaur/cyborg/both)
